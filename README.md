# itp116final
My Final Project for my ITP 116 Class at USC

This program supports two primary features. The first is for a user to receive information about a
ontinent, country or capital city (all of which are derived classes). The second feature is for a user to
contribute new information about a continent, country or capital city that they can refer to later in the
"learn" feature
