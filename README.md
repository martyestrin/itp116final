# itp116final
My Final Project for my ITP 116 Class at USC

This program supports two primary features. The first is for a user to receive information about a
ontinent, country or capital city (all of which are derived classes). The second feature is for a user to
contribute new information about a continent, country or capital city that they can refer to later in the
"learn" feature. This program requires the use of the txt file included in this GitHub repository to work properly.
